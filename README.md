|------------------|-------------|
| `CAGR`           | Measures how much a mutual fund has grown annually over a period. |
| `Sharpe Ratio`   | Evaluates the return of an investment compared to its risk. |
| `Annual Return`  | Calculated year-on-year NAV growth. |
| `Risk`           | Measured using standard deviation of NAV. |
| `Best Performing`| Based on a combination of CAGR and Sharpe Ratio. |

## Key Insights

- SBI Mutual Fund schemes showed strong long-term CAGR but moderate Sharpe Ratios.
- ICICI Mutual Fund had the **best Sharpe Ratio**, suggesting strong risk-adjusted returns.
- Nippon emerged as the **top performer** in Annual Return.
- HDFC had the **highest NAV** across all schemes.

---

## Suggestions

- Investors looking for **low-risk** options can focus on funds with **high Sharpe Ratios**.
- Funds with **consistently high CAGR** are better for long-term wealth creation.
- Additional filtering (e.g., expense ratios, sectors) could improve portfolio selection.

## How to Run the Code

### R Code:
- Install packages: `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `lubridate`, `readr`
- Load `nav_data.csv` and run `mutual_fund_analysis.R`

### PostgreSQL:
- Import cleaned NAV `.csv` files
- Execute SQL scripts in `mutual fund sql code.sql` to prepare and query data

### Power BI:
- Load `final_metrics.csv` and build visuals from scratch
- Use DAX to create KPIs for Sharpe, CAGR, NAV, Best Fund
